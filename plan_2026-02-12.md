# Cleanup Plan — Keep One Working Case

Date: 2026-02-12

## Goal

Leave exactly one canonical working results case in the repo and remove all other generated result folders/files.

## Recommended Canonical Case

Keep: `re5200_nek/`

Reason:
- It is the standard output layout already used in the repo workflow.
- It contains full run artifacts (log, figures, profiles, snapshots).
- It is the clearest baseline for future reruns.

## Current Generated Artifact Targets

Generated folders/files currently present:
- `re5200_nek/`
- `re5200_nek_long/`
- `re5200_nek_refined/`
- `re5200_nek_compare/`
- `nek_poiseuille_profile/`
- `nek_re100k_fullchannel/`
- `re5200_nek_runs_manifest.txt`

## Execution Plan

1. Confirm canonical case to keep
- Default: keep `re5200_nek/`
- If different, switch before any deletion.

2. Log pre-clean snapshot
- Save `git status --short` and top-level folder list to `LOG.md` with cleanup timestamp.

3. Remove non-canonical generated artifacts
- Delete:
  - `re5200_nek_long/`
  - `re5200_nek_refined/`
  - `re5200_nek_compare/`
  - `nek_poiseuille_profile/`
  - `nek_re100k_fullchannel/`
  - `re5200_nek_runs_manifest.txt`

4. Verify one-case-only state
- Check remaining generated case folders in repo root.
- Confirm only `re5200_nek/` remains from this investigation set.
- Verify key files still exist inside `re5200_nek/`:
  - `run.log`
  - `history.csv`
  - `profiles.csv`
  - `final_fields.png`
  - `convergence.png`
  - `snps/`

5. Record post-clean summary
- Append concise “cleaned artifacts” section to `LOG.md` with exact kept/deleted paths.

6. Commit cleanup state
- Commit docs update only (and optionally cleanup if requested tracked files are affected).
- Do not stage unrelated files.

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] One canonical results folder kept
- [ ] All other generated result folders removed
- [ ] `re5200_nek/` still has complete reproducible artifacts
- [ ] `LOG.md` contains before/after cleanup notes
- [ ] `git status --short` reflects expected minimal state
